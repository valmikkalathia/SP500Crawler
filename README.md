# SP500Crawler

This project is an implementation of a twitter search engine crawler to collect the tweets which mention SP500 companies & performs semantic analysis of tweets.

This project provides 2 options to the user: 1) Search by SP500 Company Twitter Handle & 2) Search by Keyword. A user can select either of them and search for the latest 100 tweets which mention the keyword or the company handle. We fetched the tweets using the Twitter Search API and performed Semantic Analysis on each tweet using DatumBox API which categorizes each tweet into one of the three categories (Positive, Negative or Neutral).

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX, AFS, Twitter Search API, Datumbox API.
